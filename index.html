                all variants of state symbols had a similar basis, which allows us to speak about their historical continuity.

                on coins, passports of citizens of the Republic of Belarus. 
               It is a golden contour of the State Border of the Republic of Belarus placed in a silver field, superimposed on the golden rays of the sun rising over the globe. At the top of the field is a five-pointed red star.<br>
              <br>The coat of arms is framed by a wreath of golden ears, intertwined with clover flowers on the right, flax flowers on the left. The wreath is intertwined three times on each side with a red-green ribbon, in the middle part of which the word "Republic of Belarus" is inscribed in gold in two lines at the base of the State Emblem of the Republic of Belarus.
